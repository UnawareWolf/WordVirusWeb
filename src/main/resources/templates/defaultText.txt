Overtype this text, or use it as the basis for your typographic infection: a sans-serif font which is progressively invaded by its bitmap counterpart. The process begins as bitmap cells successively replace the vector components, with the infection running progressively through the neighbouring cells. Infected cells may then degenerate further, eventually to nothing, or some level of recovery may be made. Enter your text and choose a font size. Specify which character is at the root of the infection, or allow a random one to be selected for you; choose the parameters for infection and recovery; then press “generate”.
